Build from Git
--------------

To build j4status from Git, you will need some additional dependencies:
- autoconf 2.65 (or newer)
- automake 1.11 (or newer)
- libtool
- pkg-config 0.25 (or newer) or pkgconf 0.2 (or newer)

You will also need to check out the main j4status project plus a couple of
sub-modules:

```
# git clone https://github.com/sardemff7/j4status
# cd j4status
# git submodule update
```

Once this is done, run `./autogen.sh` from the root of the `j4status/` 
directory, followed by the traditional `./configure ; make` steps.
